##  Overview

This project solves the **LunarLander-v2** environment from OpenAI Gym, where the task is to control a spacecraftâ€™s thrusters to land safely between two markers. We use **Rainbow DQN**, which integrates several modern improvements for more efficient training and environment interaction.

##  Key Features

- Full Rainbow DQN implementation with:
  - Double DQN  
  - Dueling Networks  
  - Prioritized Experience Replay  
  - Multi-step Learning  
  - Distributional RL  
  - Noisy Networks  
- Training and testing scripts with performance visualizations
- Live web demo showcasing agent behavior online

##  How It Works

1. **Environment Module** â€“ Sets up the Lunar Lander environment using OpenAI Gym.  
2. **Agent Module** â€“ Encodes the Rainbow DQN agent with multiple advanced RL components.  
3. **Training Module** â€“ Collects experience, optimizes the network, and logs rewards.  
4. **Evaluation & Demo** â€“ Runs evaluation episodes and powers a web demo to visualize agent behavior in real time.

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Gym  
- **Front-End:** Deployed to Netlify at the Live Demo URL  
- **Env:** Compatible with Google Colab / local GPU setups
